🚀 Getting Started
------------------

To run this project on your local machine, you have two options:

### Method 1: The Simple Way (Static Version)

This method works if you have manually listed your songs in the script.js file.

1.  Bashgit clone https://github.com/ankitdoi-coder/Spotify-Clone
    
2.  Bashcd your-repository-name
    
3.  **Open the index.html file** directly in your web browser.
    

### Method 2: The Dynamic Way (with a Server)

This method is for the version of the code that uses fetch() to dynamically load songs from a folder.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
    
2.  **Open the project folder in VS Code.**
    
3.  **Install the Live Server extension** from the VS Code Marketplace.
    
4.  **Right-click on index.html** and select **"Open with Live Server"**. This will start a local server and open the project in your browser.
